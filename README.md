# Programming Practice

Exercises and projects to build data engineering fundamentals.

## Purpose

This repository documents my journey learning Python, SQL, and data engineering 
patterns. Code here ranges from textbook exercises to mini-projects, showing 
progression from basics to production-ready patterns.

## Structure

- **python/**: Python exercises and mini-projects
  - `neetcode/`: Algorithm problem solving (interview prep)
  - `mini-etls/`: Small data transformation projects
  - `learning-python/`: Exercises from "Learning Python" book
  - `deep-dives/`: Explorations of specific libraries/concepts
  - `system-scripts/`: Bash and Python utilities for automation

- **sql/**: SQL practice and query optimization
  - `art-of-postgres/`: Exercises from "The Art of PostgreSQL"
  - `data-lemur/`: SQL interview questions
  - `query-optimization/`: EXPLAIN practice, indexing strategies

**Approach:** Volume over perfection, deliberate practice, learning in public
