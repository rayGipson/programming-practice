# System Scripts

Bash and Python utilities for system administration, automation, and 
practical scripting tasks. Mix of learning exercises and useful tools.

## Purpose

Build systems programming skills and create reusable utilities:
- **Bash scripting**: File operations, process management, automation
- **Python utilities**: System monitoring, log parsing, data wrangling
- **Real tools**: Scripts I actually use (not just exercises)
